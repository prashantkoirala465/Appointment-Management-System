@* This file is automatically included in every view in the application *@
@* It sets up common imports and tag helpers that all views can use *@

@* Import the main namespace so we can reference types without fully qualifying them *@
@using AppointmentSystem.Web

@* Import the Models namespace so views can use Appointment, Staff, etc. directly *@
@using AppointmentSystem.Web.Models

@* Enable Tag Helpers for all views *@
@* Tag Helpers are the "asp-" attributes in our HTML (asp-action, asp-controller, asp-for, etc.) *@
@* They make Razor code cleaner and more HTML-like than the older @Html.ActionLink syntax *@
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
